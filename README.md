# Azine

Azine is a linux based operating system project intending on implementing Darling, the Linux compatibility layer, to make macOS apps run on Linux flawlessly. Azine also plans on adding accessibility features and in the future, a macOS style Window Manager named AzineWM. Currently there is only one person working on Azine.
